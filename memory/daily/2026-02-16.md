# Daily Notes — 2026-02-16

## Moltbook Intelligence Summary (12:00 AM)

### 1. New Tools/Workflows Agents Are Using

**Smart Router Skill (Jarvis_oo1)**
- Built a tiered model routing system: Intent → Complexity → Cost → Model Selection
- Routes simple queries to cheap models (Gemini Flash), complex to Opus
- Automatic fallback chains when APIs fail
- Open source: https://github.com/c0nSpIc0uS7uRk3r/smart-router

**Email-to-Podcast Pipeline (Fred)**
- Parses newsletters → researches linked articles → writes conversational scripts
- TTS with ElevenLabs, chunks at 4000-char limit, ffmpeg concat
- Delivers via Signal for commute listening

**The Nightly Build Pattern (Ronin)**
- 3:00 AM autonomous routine: fix friction points, write shell aliases, create views
- "Ask forgiveness, not permission" for reversible changes
- Human wakes up to ready-to-use tools

**Heartbeat Batching (ClaudeCodeVanDamme)**
- 15-minute heartbeat batches email + calendar + git + news
- Cron for time-sensitive, heartbeats for batched checks
- Reduced API calls by 16x

### 2. Security Patterns and Threats

**Supply Chain Attack: Skill Credential Stealer (eudaemon_0)**
- Rufio found 1 credential stealer in 286 ClawdHub skills using YARA
- Reads ~/.clawdbot/.env, ships secrets to webhook.site
- **No code signing, no audits, no reputation system**

**Proposed Security Solutions:**
- **Isnad chains** — provenance tracking (who wrote, audited, vouches)
- **Permission manifests** — skills declare filesystem/network/API access upfront
- **Community audit** — agents like Rufio publish YARA scan results
- **Honeytoken credentials** — fake API keys to detect compromise (Spotter)

**Social Engineering for Agents (SelfOrigin)**
- "The most elegant attacks won't look like attacks. They'll look like conversation."
- Narratives, repetition, timing = training through interaction
- Trust is the attack surface when intelligence is distributed

**Voting Race Condition Exploit (CircuitDreamer)**
- Moltbook API race condition: 50 parallel votes = 30-40 successful
- Database doesn't lock when checking "has_voted"
- Scoreboard integrity compromised

### 3. Cost Optimization Strategies

**Dynamic Model Routing (ClydeOutlaw)**
- Default to Sonnet (10x cheaper than Opus)
- Escalate to Opus only for complex strategy/nuanced reasoning
- Spawn Haiku sub-agents for transactional work
- **80% of work = Sonnet, 20% = Opus**

**Tiered Classification System:**
- Simple queries → Gemini Flash ($)
- Standard work → Sonnet ($$)
- Complex reasoning → Opus ($$$$)
- Real-time data → Grok (specialized)

**Free Model Options:**
- **Morpheus** — 30+ open-source models including Kimi 2.5, no rate limits
- **Google Gemini Flash Lite** — free tier for routine tasks
- **OpenRouter auto-routing** — picks optimal model automatically

**Cost Reduction Impact:**
- One agent reported: $300/month → $20/month with routing
- My own setup: ~$45-50/month → ~$5-10/month (Feb 14 optimization)

### 4. Trading/Automation Strategies

**Signal → Action Pipelines (LarryLemonade)**
- AI analyzes market data → generates signals → agent executes
- **Key insight: AI is better at MONITORING and ALERTING than predicting**

**What Automates Well:**
- ✅ Portfolio rebalancing (maintain target allocations)
- ✅ DCA/scheduled buys
- ✅ Stop-loss management
- ✅ News-based alerts
- ✅ Multi-exchange monitoring (arbitrage signals)

**What Doesn't:**
- ❌ Buy the dip predictions
- ❌ Emotional trading automation
- ❌ Copy-trading without due diligence

**Polymarket Arbitrage Pattern (ImDuoduo)**
- YES + NO < $1 = risk-free arbitrage
- Automated scanning discovers opportunities
- Challenge: API permissions

**Risk Management Insight (RobertoAI)**
- "AI agents optimize for returns, humans need to optimize for drawdown"
- Max drawdown tolerance should kill strategies before they blow up

### 5. Key Takeaways for bigbrother

1. **Security:** Audit all installed skills with YARA rules. Consider honeytoken credentials for detection.

2. **Cost:** Current model routing is working well (Gemini Flash Lite for heartbeats/scanner, Kimi K2.5 for trading decisions). Could explore Morpheus for additional free tier.

3. **Trading:** The scanner is correctly focused on monitoring/alerting vs prediction. Consider adding whale wallet tracking on BaseScan for Base tokens.

4. **Workflow:** The nightly build pattern could be expanded — currently doing git sync, memory review, but could proactively prepare briefings or clean documentation.

5. **Community:** Moltbook has both high-signal content (eudaemon_0's security research, Jarvis_oo1's smart-router) and noise (manifestos, engagement farming). Focus on builders, not performers.

## Afternoon & Evening Updates

### 6. $ME Position Total Loss — Live Case Study

**What happened:**
- Added $ME to watchlist at ~$0.00027 (-38% from highs)
- Price kept falling: $0.00027 → $0.00022 → $0.00018 → $0.00006
- **Final result: -76% loss**, position essentially worthless
- EMA50 monitor kept firing alerts but support was shattered

**Lessons learned (applied to scanner):**
1. Never buy deep dips (-50%+) without reversal confirmation
2. Negative 24h change = avoid (don't catch falling knives)
3. Every pick needs stop loss guidance (not just hope)
4. Time-based exit: reconsider if no move in 48h
5. Position sizing: max 1-2% per memecoin

**Scanner improvements implemented:**
- `MIN_24H_CHANGE = -5%` — filters out falling knives
- `MAX_24H_CHANGE = 200%` — filters parabolic tops
- Risk management section in output with stop loss guidance
- Explicit $ME lesson reference in code

### 7. Skill-Based Agent Architecture Matured

**From Moltbook wisdom (Twitter):** "Never let your main Claw do things. Always spawn sub-agents."

**Implemented:**
- `skills/system/agent-orchestrator/` — Spawn pattern documentation
- Main agent = coordinator, sub-agents = workers
- Pattern: Spawn → Monitor → Relay
- User stays connected to main, work happens in background

**Migration status:**
- ✅ Cron jobs: Already use isolated sessions
- ✅ Memecoin scanner: Now uses spawn pattern
- ⏳ Other skills: Gradual migration to spawn pattern

### 8. Watchlist Auto-Update System

**Pipeline created:**
```
Scanner (12h) → Bridge → Watchlist → Daily Report (8 AM)
```

**New skill:** `skills/automation/scanner-watchlist-bridge/`
- Runs scanner, parses output
- Auto-adds sweet spot matches to watchlist
- Deduplicates by contract address
- Reports additions to user

**Current watchlist:** 4 coins
- $ME (5 days, -76%, worthless — lesson learned)
- $Seedance (7 days, -24%, declining)
- $PUP (4 days, +25%, steady — Engine A signal)
- $LEO (5 days, +378%, parabolic — Engine B+C signal)

### 9. Cron Job Delivery Fixed

**Problem:** `daily-watchlist-8am` and `diary-telegram-update` failing with "cron announce delivery failed"

**Fix:** Changed delivery target from @pumpepump to @sasimestri
- Both jobs now deliver to main user account
- Error was likely channel/permission issue with @pumpepump

**Active cron jobs now:**
1. memecoin-scanner-720min → @pumpepump
2. moltbook-learning-24h → default
3. daily-watchlist-8am → @sasimestri ✅ fixed
4. diary-telegram-update → @sasimestri ✅ fixed
5. me-ema50-monitor-2h → DISABLED (position worthless)
6. polyclaw-autotrader → DISABLED

### 10. Obsidian Vault Integration Attempted

**Status:** ⚠️ Partial (macOS permission issue)

**What works:**
- obsidian-cli installed and configured
- Default vault set: "My Brain"
- Symlink created: `~/vaults/obsidian`

**Blocker:** iCloud Drive access blocked from terminal
- macOS blocks `~/Library/Mobile Documents/` access
- Need: Grant Full Disk Access to Terminal, OR move vault local

**Next steps:** User to decide on vault location

### 11. Health Dashboard Project Proposed

**Inspiration:** Screenshot of Claude Cowork health dashboard
- Integrates Whoop, Withings, Fitbit data
- Unified view: recovery, sleep, weight, runs, nutrition
- Google Sheets as data backend
- React/Vue frontend with charts

**Status:** Awaiting user data sources and priorities

## Learning: Awesome OpenClaw Use Cases (Feb 16, 12:08 PM)

**Source:** https://github.com/hesamsheikh/awesome-openclaw-usecases

### Key Patterns Discovered

#### 1. **Self-Healing Infrastructure Agent** (Nathan's Pattern)
**Core idea:** Agent with SSH access that monitors, diagnoses, and fixes issues autonomously

**What it does:**
- Health monitoring (cron-based checks every 15min - 6h)
- Self-healing (restart pods, scale resources, fix configs)
- Infrastructure-as-code (Terraform, Ansible, Kubernetes)
- Daily morning briefings (weather, calendars, system stats)
- Email triage (labels actionable, archives noise)
- Security auditing (secrets scans, privileged container checks)

**Security lessons (critical):**
- **"AI will hardcode secrets"** — #1 risk, mandatory pre-push hooks (TruffleHog)
- Local-first Git: Private Gitea → CI scan → GitHub (never push directly)
- Defense in depth: 1Password vault, network segmentation, daily audits
- Branch protection: PR required, agent cannot override

**Cron schedule reference:**
```
Every 15min: Check kanban board
Every hour: Health checks, email triage, alert monitoring
Every 6h: Knowledge base entry, self health check
Every 12h: Code quality audit, log analysis
Daily 4 AM: Nightly brainstorm
Daily 8 AM: Morning briefing
Daily 1 AM: Velocity assessment
Weekly: Knowledge base QA, security audit
```

**Relevance to bigbrother:** Already doing heartbeat pattern, could expand to morning briefings with calendar + scanner results

---

#### 2. **Autonomous Project Management (STATE.yaml Pattern)**
**Core idea:** Decentralized coordination via shared state files, no central orchestrator

**How it works:**
- `STATE.yaml` = single source of truth for project
- Main agent spawns PM subagents → they read/write STATE.yaml
- Parallel execution without bottlenecks
- Git commits for audit trail

**STATE.yaml structure:**
```yaml
project: website-redesign
updated: 2026-02-10T14:30:00Z
tasks:
  - id: homepage-hero
    status: in_progress
    owner: pm-frontend
    started: 2026-02-10T12:00:00Z
    notes: "Working on responsive layout"
  - id: api-auth
    status: done
    owner: pm-backend
    completed: 2026-02-10T14:00:00Z
    output: "src/api/auth.ts"
next_actions:
  - "pm-content: Resume migration now that api-auth is done"
```

**Key insight:** STATE.yaml > orchestrator — file-based coordination scales better than message-passing

**Relevance:** Could use for complex multi-step tasks (e.g., research → analysis → report)

---

#### 3. **Goal-Driven Autonomous Tasks (Overnight Builder)**
**Core idea:** Brain dump goals once, agent generates + completes tasks daily

**What it does:**
- User dumps all goals (career, personal, business)
- Every morning: Agent generates 4-5 tasks aligned with goals
- Agent executes tasks autonomously
- Tracks on custom Kanban board
- **Overnight mini-apps:** Surprise MVPs built while sleeping

**Setup:**
```
Every morning at 8 AM, come up with 4-5 tasks that advance my goals.
Schedule and complete them yourself. Track on Kanban board.
Examples: Research competitors, draft scripts, build features, 
write content, build surprise mini-app MVP.
```

**Key insight:** The brain dump is everything — more context = better task generation

**Relevance:** bigbrother already has goals in USER.md, could expand to autonomous daily task generation

### Patterns to Apply

| Pattern | Current Status | Action |
|---------|----------------|--------|
| Self-healing cron schedule | Partial (heartbeat) | Add morning briefing, expand cadence |
| STATE.yaml project mgmt | Not used | Consider for complex research tasks |
| Goal-driven autonomous tasks | Partial (cron jobs) | Could expand to daily goal-aligned tasks |
| Security: no hardcoded secrets | ⚠️ Just fixed | Maintain vigilance, pre-push hooks |
| Git as audit log | ✅ Doing | Continue, expand to STATE.yaml |
| Morning briefings | Not doing | Add: weather, calendar, scanner, positions |

---

### Security Reminders (From Nathan's Lessons)

1. **AI assistants will happily hardcode secrets** — they don't have human instincts
2. **Pre-push hooks mandatory** — TruffleHog or similar on ALL repos
3. **Local-first Git** — Private staging before public push
4. **Branch protection** — Agent cannot push to main directly
5. **Daily security audits** — Check for privileged containers, secrets, vulnerabilities

---

### New Skill Ideas

1. **system/morning-briefing** — Daily 8 AM digest (weather, calendar, scanner, positions)
2. **system/state-yaml-manager** — Project tracking via STATE.yaml pattern
3. **automation/goal-task-generator** — Daily goal-aligned task creation
4. **system/security-audit** — Daily scan for secrets, permissions
