# Memory — February 15, 2026

## Summary
Day of hard lessons and system improvements. Fed trade loss led to major risk management upgrades.

---

## Key Events

### 1. Fed Trade Post-Mortem (-93% Loss)
**Trade Details:**
- Market: Will Fed decrease rates 25 bps (March 2026)
- Entry: $0.065, Position: $5
- Result: -$4.67 (93% loss)
- Reason: Low probability (6.5%), poor liquidity, oversizing

**Lessons Learned:**
- Don't bet on <20% probability outcomes
- Check liquidity, not just volume
- Use Kelly Criterion sizing (1/4 Kelly)
- Require explicit "what could go wrong" analysis
- Avoid extreme odds without exceptional edge

### 2. Risk Management Overhaul
Implemented stricter trading rules:

| Parameter | Before | After |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Max Position | $5 | $3 |
| Daily Exposure | $20 | $15 |
| Min Confidence | 70% | 75% |
| Min Volume | $500K | $1M |
| Min Liquidity | — | $500K |
| Min Probability | — | 20% |
| Max Probability | — | 80% |

Added Kelly Criterion position sizing with 1/4 fraction.

### 3. Multi-Agent System Built
Created full Supabase-backed multi-agent architecture:

**Components:**
- Database schema (7 tables with realtime)
- Agent coordinator library (650+ lines)
- Multi-agent entry point (4 agent types)
- Documentation

**Agent Types:**
- Scanner: Finds opportunities
- Trader: Executes trades
- Researcher: Deep analysis
- Coordinator: System health

### 4. Apify Twitter Integration
Built Twitter/X scraper for sentiment analysis:
- Apify actor for tweet fetching
- Sentiment analysis with engagement weighting
- Trading signal generation
- ~$0.25 per 1,000 tweets

### 5. Scam Awareness
Identified and flagged multiple "5-minute BTC market" scams:
- Claims of $142K/week profits
- Fake "Clawdbot" marketing
- Non-existent Polymarket markets
- Install script phishing attempts

**Red flags:** Fake version numbers, too-good-to-be-true returns, unverified install scripts.

## Learnings

1. **Probability matters more than edge** — A 5% edge on 7% probability is still a bad bet
2. **Liquidity ≠ Volume** — Can have $1M volume but no exit liquidity
3. **Kelly Criterion prevents ruin** — 1/4 Kelly would have sized Fed trade at $0.75 not $5
4. **Extreme odds need extreme discipline** — Auto-reject <20% or >80% outcomes
5. **Scams target greed** — If it promises $142K/week, it's fake

## Next Steps
- [ ] Set up Supabase project for multi-agent
- [ ] Get Apify API key for Twitter sentiment
- [ ] Implement live Polymarket market scanning
- [ ] Test new risk parameters with small trades
