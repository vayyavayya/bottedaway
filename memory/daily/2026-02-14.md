# Memory — February 14, 2026

## Summary
Enhanced memory architecture implemented. System now follows structured memory organization pattern.

---

## Memory Structure Upgrade

Created organized memory architecture:

```
memory/
├── INDEX.md              ← Navigation map (read first)
├── daily/                ← Rolling 7-day window
│   └── 2026-02-13.md
├── projects/             ← Active projects
├── reference/            ← Stable docs
│   ├── api-reference.md
│   ├── trading-rules.md
│   ├── scanner-workflow.md
│   └── voice-guide.md
├── meetings/             ← Meeting transcripts
│   ├── agency/
│   ├── content/
│   ├── external/
│   └── internal/
├── archive/              ← Historical logs
│   └── scanner-2026-02-14.log
└── heartbeat-state.json
```

## MiniMax Integration

- Added MiniMax M2.5 as available model via Anthropic API
- Base URL: `https://api.minimax.io/anthropic`
- Model ID: `MiniMax-M2.5`
- Context: 204,800 tokens
- Primary model remains Kimi K2.5 for now

## Trading Rules Refinement

- Removed attribution from trading rules (now generic)
- Rules remain hardcoded in scanner
- Documented in `reference/trading-rules.md`

---

## Telegram Channel

- Added bot to @learnedlikeabitch channel
- Can now push learnings automatically

---

## Files Modified

- Created `memory/INDEX.md`
- Created `memory/reference/*.md` (4 files)
- Created `memory/daily/`, `projects/`, `meetings/*`, `archive/`
- Moved `2026-02-13.md` → `daily/`
- Moved scanner log → `archive/`

---

## Next Steps

- [ ] Populate voice-guide.md with 85-post analysis
- [ ] Set up Supabase project
- [ ] Connect scanner to dashboard
